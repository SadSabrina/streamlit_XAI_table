# Find a way to make your AI explainable

Here you can find a library offering model interpretation methods tailored to your needs. The classification of libraries was implemented considering practical characteristics that influence the feasibility of using specific interpretation methods. It was found that, in practice, the choice of a particular library depends on:

- The type of data the model was trained on
- The framework used to train the model

Accordingly, this filtering is implemented here.

## About the Project

The project aims to assist developers and researchers in selecting appropriate tools for interpreting machine learning models. We provide a convenient interface for filtering and choosing libraries based on your requirements and conditions.

## Key Features

- **Data Type**: Filter libraries based on the type of data (tabular data, images, text, etc.) you are working with.
- **Framework**: Support for popular frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and others.
